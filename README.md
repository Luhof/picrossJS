# picrossJS
picross clone in javascript<br/>
demo : http://luhof.fr/games/picross/

##todo

- better hints (numbers should be grey once corresponding tiles are correctly filled)
- level manager/editor
- draw lines instead of dots


I don't know if I'll ever be brave enough to continue this project, but it was a nice way of practising object JS.
